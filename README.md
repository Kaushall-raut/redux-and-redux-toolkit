Learning Redux and Redux Toolkit
I'm currently learning Redux to manage the state of my React applications more effectively. Redux helps keep all the important data (state) of the app in one central place, making it easier to manage, debug, and scale as the app grows.

To make things easier, I'm using Redux Toolkit, which is the official way to write Redux code with less boilerplate and cleaner syntax.

What I'm learning:
How to use createSlice() to create actions and reducers easily

How to set up a store using configureStore()

How to connect Redux to React components using useSelector and useDispatch

How to manage async actions using createAsyncThunk()
